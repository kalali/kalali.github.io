# Proactive vs Reactive Working in Software Development


## Intro
I was a guest at the [The Exchange Nordics Podcast](https://evolution-nordics.com/category/podcast/) recently around this subject and decided to write a bit more detailed blog post with my thourhts more organized. I recommend listening to the podcast as the other guests had views into the subject from different angles which enriches the understanding.
## What is Reactive and Proactive working?

Looking at the Oxford dictionary for the adjectives definition I find the the brief but clear description as follows

{{< admonition type=quote title="Reactive" open=true >}}
showing a reaction or response
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="Proactive" open=true >}}
controlling a situation by making things happen rather than waiting for things to happen and then reacting to them
{{< /admonition >}}

The description is clear on what the approaches are, but there some chracteristics that forms each one of them:
### Characteristics of Proactive working

### Characterestics of Reactive working



## Reactive and Proactive at the same time
There arent that many businesses that would only thrive on a single approach but rather a mix of the two approaches at play in different situations. From the individual up to the strategic directions a mix of the approaches are at play:
- At the individual level the reactive approach to a server being down is to bring it up. An the proactive component is to look into why the server was down and how to either prevent the server being down or to restart it automatically when it is down and to send a notification about it.
- At the organization level the reactive approach is most often the change in the business landscape. For example offering a particular service and getting no traction for it, the reactive response might be sunsetting the service. The proactive approach is doing extensive market research on the possible service usage and adoption before developing the next service.

Different organizations budget different amount of time by default for the reactive work that needs to be done, I have seen from 10-90 down to 50-50 split between the time that is allocated for reactive and proactive work by the individuals and teams.
