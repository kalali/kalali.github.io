    <description><![CDATA[Like other operating system we can assign multiple IP address to a network interface. This secondary address are called logical interfaces and we can use them to make one machine with one single network interface own multiple IP addresses for different purposes. We may need to assign multiple IP address to an interface to make it available to both internal and external networks or for testing purposes. We should have one network interface configured in our system in order to create additional logical interfaces.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Link aggregation or commonly known Ethernet bonding allows us to enhance the network availability and performance by combining multiple network interfaces together and form an aggregation of those interfaces which act as a single network interface with greatly enhanced availability and performance.
When we aggregate two or more network interfaces, we are forming a new network interface on top of those physical interfaces combined in the link layer.
We need to have at least two network interfaces in our machine to create a link aggregation.]]></description>
