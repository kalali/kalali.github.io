            </div>Reading is one of the activities I enjoy, being sci-fi and fantasy books or textbooks around my career or other science and society-related topics. The same applies to newsletters and other types of well-researched opinion articles about science, tech, business, and philosophy. There are some excellent podcasts that I follow and listen to the choice of episodes or every episode they publish.
The majority of my reading, when it comes to books, is in form of listening.]]></description>
