            </div>Intro I was a guest at the The Exchange Nordics Podcast a while back around this subject and decided to write a bit more detailed blog post with my thoughts more organized. I recommend listening to the podcast as the other guests had views on the subject from different angles which enriches the understanding.
What are Reactive and Proactive working? Looking at the Oxford dictionary for the adjective&rsquo;s definition I find the brief but clear description as follows]]></description>

            </div>Reading is one of the activities I enjoy, being sci-fi and fantasy books or textbooks around my career or other science and society-related topics. The same applies to newsletters and other types of well-researched opinion articles about science, tech, business, and philosophy. There are some excellent podcasts that I follow and listen to the choice of episodes or every episode they publish.
The majority of my reading, when it comes to books, is in form of listening.]]></description>

            </div>This is one of the common principles that not only software developers are adhering to, but also the whole of civilization is attempting to adhere to. But it is sometimes not as easy as it may sound to figure out the right problem, and, more importantly, what is the right level.
A simple example is a pull request fixing a small bug that should not be blocked because of an architectural decision made a year ago and has about 5 engineer years&rsquo; worth of work built around it.]]></description>

            </div>Fragmentation of Java runtimes in a microservices-based architecture There are many many differences between the monolithic architecture and microservices-based architecture. One of them is the number of independently deployed bits of software, with a monolith there are usually many replicas of the same distribution running on many machines, virtualized or not. With the Microservices the number of independently deployed software systems grows as the different contexts raise&hellip; or an already existing context boundary grows enough to be split.]]></description>

            </div>From Monolith to Microservices Having redundancy in application space is pretty common. We have all seen them for decades in different ways. Hardware, software layer 4, or layer 7, etc. All of them what they do they direct traffic based on a given decision-making rule to a destination. Being weighted round-robin, resource/load-based metrics, etc. All they do is reliably direct traffic to a healthy node in the destination.
In a very simple and basic view with VMs and data centers, if VMs fail the load balancer will direct loads to identical VMs, all nodes more or less can handle any of the incoming requests (ignoring stickiness, etc.]]></description>

            </div>Last week I was talking to a former colleague, he is running a SaaS startup now, and our conversation went around SRE, production, and reliability. We talked a lot about architectural attributes that relate or impact the incidents, from detection to recovery, and on to prevention. I thought to put some of my thoughts around architecture into a blog post since that was the core of our conversation. The next post I will cover more details on architecture for fault tolerance.]]></description>

            </div>What I have learned about successful teams is the trust and the belief in the team&rsquo;s mission. Trust in the mission, baring some issues like ill-fitting team members, etc. is the single most important factor for success of an individual, a team or a team of teams.
When the group of individuals that are part of the said team cannot see a mission they trust, going through the famous steps of Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing will be harder.]]></description>

Deeper understanding of what the business about Get a view of the system&rsquo;s architecture for the software system and the deployment view.

            </div>Introduction During the past 20 years I have seen trends come and go; one of the thing that has stayed around in one or another form is the term architecture and the architect role. Of course, there are plenty of overloads for the term and plenty of architect archetype like domain architect, enterprise architects, IT architect, network architect, software architect and you name it.
Wikipedia has a good definition of software architecture that I quote below:]]></description>

            </div>Amount of information about how a new component or software system can solve all the problem in a specific area is sometimes overboard. The hotter the topic or the framework the more information is scattered around the web for it. For example:
Have you seen the plenty of use cases that every vendor in every segment of tech stack provide as part of the adoption or success story? How about the tutorial that shows how quickly and easily something as significant as a an observability solution can be set and be up and running?]]></description>
