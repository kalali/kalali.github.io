# About me, Masoud Kalali


I am a principal software engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where I am focused on AWS Billing. In recent years I have worked on Java EE specifications and application servers (GlassFish and WebLogic), cloud platform controllers, and application development platforms. These days I am more focused on technical leadership, cloud, architecture, and ensuring good development cadence. My responsibilities are more in coaching and mentoring, ensuring alignments, and assisting organizations with tech strategy, architecture, adoption of new technologies and practices, planning, and implementations when the area of impact is across organization boundaries.

I like the thrill of innovating, building, or rebuilding. It is as giving existence to something that is not; being software engineering or small tinkering projects. I like the outdoors and most often I go for a long trail run to unwind.

I authored a book and co-authored another a decade ago [Glassfish Security](https://www.amazon.com/GlassFish-Security-Masoud-Kalali/dp/1847199380) and [Developing RESTful Services with JAX-RS 2.0, WebSockets, and JSON](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782178120/). At some point I was editor of some [Dzone's Zones](https://dzone.com/users/89352/Kalali.html) and put some writing into that portal Whenever I get the chance I read books ranging from sci-fi and fantasy to leadership and management; every now and then I binge a bunch of articles or blogs that I have bookmarked to go through. Recently I revived this blog (Removed about 110 posts that were outdated) to start writing again.
