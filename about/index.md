# About me, Masoud Kalali

I work in the software industry and have been involved with software development since 2000. Delphi, .Net, and J2SE back in the time, and now I am more focused on technical leadership, cloud, architecture, and getting organizations closer to realizing their potential and goals. My responsibilities are more in ensuring alignments and assisting organizations with tech strategy, architecture, adoption of new technologies and practices, planning, and implementations when the area of impact is across organization boundaries.

I like the thrill of innovating, building, or rebuilding. It is as giving existence to something that is not; being software engineering or small tinkering projects. I like the outdoors and most often I go for a long trail run to unwind.

I authored a book and co-authored another a decade ago [Glassfish Security](https://www.amazon.com/GlassFish-Security-Masoud-Kalali/dp/1847199380) and [Developing RESTful Services with JAX-RS 2.0, WebSockets, and JSON
](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782178120/). At some point I was editor of some [Dzone's Zones](https://dzone.com/users/89352/Kalali.html) and put some writing into that portal Whenever I get the chance I read books ranging from sci-fi and fantasy to leadership and management; every now and then I binge a bunch of articles or blogs that I have bookmarked to go through. Recently I revived this blog (Removed about 110 posts that were outdated) to start writing again.
