# About me, Masoud Kalali

I work in software industry; help organisations and team get to the destination they want to get to become or stay successful and relevant. I can still write code! but doing that less than before. I enjoy following technology and societies trends, and examining them in relation to my responsibilities.

I like the thrill of innovating, building or rebuilding. I enjoy it because it is as giving existence to something that is not there; this is being software engineering or small tinkering projects. I like outdoors, mountains, open land, I like water sports; and the prime of my activities is running, mountain running that is (I am not good at it).

I use a split mechanical keyboard, works most times from my home office, grow cactus and other plants in my office to keep it green and more homy if that is a term.

I like reading, and also writing. Authored a book and co-authored another a decade ago. Whenever I get the chance I read books ranging from sci-fi and fantasy to leadership and management; every now and then I binge a bunch of articles or blogs that I have bookmarked to go through.
